Ignore Cam data for now 

Oatmeal cookie
Set things up
```{r}
rm(list = ls())
library(here)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
```

Pull in data
```{r}
cam <- read.csv(here("Data", "north-country-wild-classifications.csv"), stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
mammal <- read.csv(here("Data", "MammalMatrixExample.csv"), stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
```

Quick summary
```{r}
summary(cam)
```
There is a lot going on here. But I can see that each entry has it's own subject ID which is good. 

```{r}
summary(mammal)
```
I can see here the data is in "wide" format with each species identified having it's own column. I don't see any repeating/misspelled species.
